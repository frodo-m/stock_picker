Stock picker, TOP exercise

The code works, yet the solution is not very elegent, but it's okay for now...

1. Initialize variables for max profit (greatest differential) & best buy & sell days
2. Iterate over the array's elements & indices
3. Initialize a variable that hold the profit, which is selling minus buy, obviously, otherwise it won't be considered a profit
4. Ensure that buy day comes before the selling day
5. Return the result

That's it
