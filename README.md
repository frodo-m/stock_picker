Stock picker, TOP exercise

The code works, yet the solution is not very elegent, but it's okay for now...

1. Initialize variable for max profit (greatest differential)
2. Initialize variable for best buy & sell days
3. Iterate over the array's elements & indices, once for buying and one for selling values (price, day) 
4. Initialize a variable that hold the profit, which is sell price minus buy price, obviously, otherwise it won't be considered a profit
5. Ensure that buy day comes before the selling day
6. Return the result

That's it
